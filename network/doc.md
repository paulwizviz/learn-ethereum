# Nodes and Networks

This section discusses node and network.

## Node

An Ethereum node is a host for two Ethereum clients: a consensus client and an execution client.

### Working Example



## Networks

Ethereum is a decentralised network of nodes running software that can verify blocks and transaction data.

There are several types of networks. Refer to this [list of networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/).
