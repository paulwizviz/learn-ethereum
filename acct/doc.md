# Accounts

An Ethereum account is an entity with an ether (ETH) balance that can send transactions on Ethereum. Accounts can be user-controlled or deployed as smart contracts ([source](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/)).

There are two well known types of Ethereum accounts:

* Externally Owned Account
* Contract Account

There is another "official" contract-based version known as [ERC 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) also called "Account abstraction".

## Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs):

* Controlled by private keys (users interact with Ethereum using EOAs).
* Contains:
	* **Nonce**: Prevents replay attacks by counting transactions.
	* **Balance**: The amount of Ether in the account.
	* **No code or storage**.

## Contract Accounts:

* Associated with deployed smart contracts.
* Contains:
    * **Nonce**: Tracks the number of contract creations by the account.
    * **Balance**: Holds Ether.
    * **Code**: The compiled bytecode of the smart contract.
    * **Storage**: Persistent key-value storage for the contractâ€™s state.
