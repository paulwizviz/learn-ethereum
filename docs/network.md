# Ethereum network

Ethereum is a distributed network of computers (known as nodes) running software that can verify blocks and transaction data. The software must be run on your computer to turn it into an Ethereum node. There are two separate pieces of software (known as 'clients') required to form a node[source](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/).
 
## Setting up a private network

Please refer to the [official docs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/private-network) describing the steps to create a private network.

To help you create a private network, this project has provided the following resources:

* [./deployments/private/docker-compose.yaml](../deployments/private/docker-compose.yaml)
* [./scripts/privnet.sh](../scripts/privnet.sh) to help you create a private network
